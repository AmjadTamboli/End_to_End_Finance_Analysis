# Financial Reporting Automation System


# Project Overview

This project simulates an end-to-end automated accounting workflow that converts raw journal entries into structured ledgers, financial statements, and real-time financial analytics dashboards.

The goal was to eliminate manual accounting processes and build a scalable system capable of handling high-volume transactions while generating decision-ready insights.

# Objective

To design and automate a financial reporting pipeline that:

Processes large volumes of journal entries

Generates automated ledgers and trial balance

Produces financial statements

Performs ratio and growth analysis

Enables real-time MIS dashboards

# aggregation logic

Power BI — financial dashboard & visualization

DAX — YoY / MoM analytics

Accounting logic — journal → ledger → statements

System Architecture

# Journal Entries
→ Automated VBA processing
→ SQL ledger structure
→ Trial Balance generation
→ Financial Statements
→ Ratio & Growth Dashboard

This pipeline replicates a real-world accounting workflow.
